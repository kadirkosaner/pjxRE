# Fotogram DM – Flow design (from scratch)

**Scope:** DM only. English. Realistic → flirty. Text-only for now.  
**Idea:** Anon starts normal; after ~2 messages slowly shows interest; by ~6 messages total their intent is clear (flirty / wanting more).

---

## Principles

- **Message 1–2:** Neutral, friendly, could be anyone (curious about profile, small talk).
- **Message 3–4:** Light flirt, compliments, “you seem fun / interesting” – intent still soft.
- **Message 5–6:** Intent clear: flirty, maybe pic/meet/“take this further” hints (still text-only in this design).
- **Our replies:** Always 2–3 options that change tone: keep it chill / lean in / set boundary (or exit). So we shape whether it stays friendly or becomes flirty.

## Single flow (6 messages – anon → us → anon → us → anon → us)

Numbering: **A** = anon, **U** = us (player choice). “Us” lines are the options we offer.

---

### Message 1 — Anon opens

**A:** One of (pick one per conversation):

- "Hey, your profile came up and I had to say hi."
- "Hi, saw your posts – you seem really cool. Mind if I message?"
- "Hello! Random message from a stranger, but your feed caught my eye."
- "Hey there, just wanted to say your profile stands out. What’s your story?"

**Goal:** Feels like a normal, slightly curious opener. No flirt yet.

---

### Message 2 — We reply (first real choice)

**U (choose one):**

- **Chill:** "Hey, thanks. Yeah, just scrolling. What’s up?"
- **Friendly:** "Hi! Sure, always up for a chat. What made you message?"
- **Short / boundary:** "Hi. I’m not really on here to chat much, but thanks."

**Goal:** We set the tone: open to chat, or keeping distance.

---

### Message 3 — Anon reacts and softens / flirts a bit

**A (depends a bit on what we chose; examples):**

- If we were **chill/friendly:** "Nothing much, just thought you looked interesting. You post a lot of [X] – do you do that often? You seem fun."
- If we were **short:** "No worries. If you change your mind, I’m around. You’ve got a nice vibe, that’s all."

**Goal:** Still polite, but “you seem fun / interesting / nice vibe” = first light flirt. No pressure.

---

### Message 4 — We reply again

**U (choose one):**

- **Stay chill:** "Haha, I guess. Just here for the vibes. You?"
- **Lean in:** "You’re sweet. I like a bit of banter. Keep going."
- **Boundary:** "I’m flattered but not really looking for anything. Thanks though."

**Goal:** We either keep it neutral, encourage a bit, or gently close the door.

---

### Message 5 — Anon makes intent clearer

**A (examples):**

- If we **leaned in:** "I’m glad you said that. I’ve been thinking about you since I saw your profile, not gonna lie. Would be fun to get to know you better."
- If we **stayed chill:** "Same, just vibes. Though I can’t lie – you’re really attractive. Anyway, what do you do when you’re not posting?"
- If we **set boundary:** "Totally get it. I’ll leave you be. Take care."

**Goal:** If we engaged → anon is clearly interested (flirty, “get to know you better”). If we chilled → one compliment then back to small talk. If we closed → anon exits politely.

---

### Message 6 — We reply (last of this block)

**U (choose one):**

- **Friendly / flirty:** "I’m down to keep talking. You’re not bad yourself."
- **Playful:** "Haha, smooth. Okay, I’m curious. What do you want to know?"
- **Cool off:** "Let’s keep it light for now. Just chatting."
- **Exit:** "This was nice but I’m gonna go. Bye."

**Goal:** We either match the flirty tone, stay “just chatting,” or end it. After this, “intent” is clear on both sides (flirty path vs friendly vs ended).

---

## What happens after message 6 (for later)

- **Flirty path:** Can extend to more back‑and‑forth, then later (separate design) add: pic request, number swap, etc. For this doc we stop at “intent clear, text-only.”
- **Friendly path:** Can loop 1–2 more neutral messages or offer “talk later” / end.
- **Exit path:** Anon says bye / we don’t show more choices.

## Summary table

| Message | Who   | Purpose |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1      | Anon  | Normal opener, curious |
| 2      | Us    | Set tone: chill / friendly / boundary |
| 3      | Anon  | Light flirt (“you seem fun / nice vibe”) |
| 4      | Us    | Stay chill / lean in / boundary |
| 5      | Anon  | Intent clear: flirty vs friendly vs exit |
| 6      | Us    | Match flirty / keep light / exit |

## Next steps (when you’re ready)

1. Add **variants**: more opener lines, more anon lines per message (so it’s not the same every time).
2. Split **branches** in the doc: “if U chose chill at 2” → anon pool A; “if U chose lean in” → anon pool B.
3. Define **what to keep** from current code (e.g. scenario type, node keys) and what to rename/rewrite so this flow fits.

No code in this doc – flow design only. When you’re happy with this structure, we can either deepen the branches here or plan how to map it into nodes/choices.
