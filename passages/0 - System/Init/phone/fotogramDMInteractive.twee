    "Bestie I need to tell you – you are GORGEOUS and your feed is literal fire 💕✨",
    "Okay miss hot girl summer ALL YEAR ROUND. Save some heat for the rest of us 😩💅",
    "I'm a straight woman and even I had to stop and stare. You're that level of hot. 🔥",
    "As one girl to another – you're stunning and I hope you know that 💕",
    "I literally showed your pic to my friend group and everyone went SILENT. That's how hot you are.",
    "How does someone look this good?? Is it the genes? The water? What is it?? 😂🔥",
    "Not me fanning myself while scrolling your feed. At work. In front of my boss. 😂",
    "You give off 'hottest person in any room' energy and I'm absolutely here for it.",
    "I've been thinking about messaging you for days. That latest photo sealed the deal.",
    "I need you to know that your feed has personally victimized me with its hotness. Daily.",
    "Most people are hot sometimes. You're hot ALWAYS. The consistency is terrifying.",
    "I've run out of fire emojis. I've used them all on your posts. Send more emojis.",
    "I had to DM you before someone else did and said what I'm thinking. You're SCORCHING.",
    "If there's a 'too hot for this app' list, you're at the top. At the very, very top.",
    "I can't have a productive day when you post. It's either work or stare at your photos. I chose wrong.",
    "Somebody owes me damages for how hot your posts are. My productivity is GONE.",
    "My brain has two modes: normal, and 'just saw her latest post.' They're very different modes.",
    "You could post a photo of literally ANYTHING and it would still be the hottest thing on my feed.",
    "I've been trying to DM you something cool for 30 minutes. Giving up. You're hot. That's all I've got.",
    "I tried typing 'you're beautiful' but autocorrect kept changing it to 'you're insanely beautiful.' Even my phone knows.",
    "If your photos were any hotter my phone would need a cooling fan.",
    "Not to be dramatic but I would cross oceans for one reply from you. That's the level of hot we're at.",
    "I don't have a smooth line. I don't have a clever opener. I just have: you're the hottest person alive. Bye.",
    "Every new photo you post raises the bar higher. Nobody else can reach it. Not even close."

  /* ── TEASING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
  teasing: [
    "That post left just enough to the imagination and now my imagination is RUNNING.",
    "You're such a tease. And I mean that as the highest compliment. Had to DM you.",
    "I've been staring at that photo trying to see more and hating you a little for not showing it.",
    "You know exactly what you're doing with these teasing posts. And it's working. Obviously.",
    "The way you show just enough to drive people crazy... it's an art form. You're an artist.",
    "I opened that photo expecting more. Got exactly enough to lose my mind. Well played.",
    "You left me wanting more and that's the most effective thing anyone has ever done to me online.",
    "That little peek you gave in that photo... I haven't stopped thinking about it. Had to DM.",
    "I hate being teased. I love being teased by you. These are conflicting emotions.",
    "The way you hint without showing... it's worse than showing everything. And you know that. 😏",
    "I've been going crazy since that photo. You showed just enough to destroy my ability to focus.",
    "That tease of a post has me refreshing your page hoping for a follow-up. Please.",
    "You're playing a game with your followers and somehow you're winning every round.",
    "I've never been so frustrated and turned on by a single photo. Teach me your ways.",
    "The way that strap was slipping... was it on purpose? Because if so, you're evil. Beautiful, but evil.",
    "I keep imagining what's just outside the frame and it's ruining my productivity.",
    "You posted that knowing EXACTLY what would happen in your DMs. Calculated evil genius.",
    "I can see just enough in that photo to know I need to see more. Which is exactly your plan, isn't it?",
    "The art of the tease is dead everywhere except your page. You're keeping it alive.",
    "I zoomed in, panned around, and STILL didn't get what I was looking for. You win. I'm in your DMs.",
    "That barely-there reveal is more effective than any explicit photo I've ever seen. No joke.",
    "You gave us 10% and I'm here BEGGING for the other 90%. Like actually begging.",
    "I've been looking at that photo for 20 minutes trying to decide if I can see what I think I see.",
    "The way you use angles to suggest without showing... you should work in Hollywood.",
    "My imagination has been working overtime since that photo and I need you to take responsibility.",
    "You tease like a professional. And I mean that with awe, respect, and a little bit of frustration.",
    "That post was basically a trailer for a movie I'd pay any price to watch.",
    "I can't decide if I love you or hate you for that tease. Probably both. Definitely both.",
    "You showed me just enough to know I'm in trouble. And then you stopped. EVIL.",
    "That photo is the visual equivalent of someone whispering something dirty and then walking away.",
    "I need the director's cut of that photo. The teaser version has me going insane.",
    "You're a master of mystery and I'm a helpless victim of your craft.",
    "Every tease you post makes me follow harder. I'm basically a hostage at this point.",
    "The gap between what I see and what I imagine in that photo is torturing me. And you love it.",
    "You didn't show too much. You didn't show too little. You showed EXACTLY enough to break me.",
    "That photo is the meanest and nicest thing anyone has ever done to me at the same time.",
    "I've replayed that photo in my head about 40 times and each time my brain adds a little more. Dangerous.",
    "If teasing was a sport, you'd be a first-ballot hall of famer. Retired jersey number and everything.",
    "I thought I was immune to tease posts. Then you came along and shattered that illusion.",
    "The way you leave things to the imagination is genuinely cruel. Cruel and addicting.",
    "I've been imagining the uncropped version of that photo and it's consuming my thoughts.",
    "You posted a question mark and my brain filled in the answer. The answer was: I'm obsessed.",
    "That tease hit harder than any reveal ever could. And I think you know that.",
    "I keep going back to that photo hoping it'll show more if I look long enough. It won't. But I keep trying.",
    "The way that towel was wrapped... the way that shirt was unbuttoned... CALCULATED. All of it.",
    "I'm DMing you because I need answers. Specifically: what's behind the crop? This is important.",
    "You just showed the world a trailer and now we all want the full movie. Pay-per-view. I'll pay.",
    "That tiny flash of skin did more to me than most explicit content ever has. You're a witch.",
    "My brain: 'it's just a tease, move on.' Also my brain: 'BUT WHAT IF SHE SHOWS MORE NEXT TIME.'",
    "I've never been so invested in someone's 'almost showing' content. You've got me on a hook.",
    "That photo was a promise. And I'm here in your DMs asking when you plan to deliver.",
    "Girl you are EVIL for that tease and I respect the hell out of it 😩🔥",
    "Bestie the way you left us hanging with that photo??? RUDE. But also brilliant. 💅",
    "Okay sis how do you tease like that without driving yourself crazy?? Teach me your patience 😂",
    "I'm a girl and even I'm like 'show more please?' 😂 You've got EVERYONE wrapped around your finger.",
    "That peek was so calculated and so effective. You really said 'leave them wanting more' and MEANT it.",
    "The mystery of that photo is going to keep me up tonight. That's a fact. Thanks for that. 😩💕",
    "I've been staring at that tease trying to fill in the blanks and it's genuinely consuming my evening.",
    "If you ever decide to show more, I need to be the first to know. Setting up alerts on your page rn.",
    "You give us just a taste and then walk away. It's diabolical. And incredibly effective.",
    "That photo is the definition of 'less is more' and I hate that it works so well.",
    "I came to your DMs to complain about the tease. But also to thank you for the tease. It's complicated.",
    "Not me zooming in 400% trying to see past the fabric. You made me this way. 🔍😂",
    "That photo was strategic and I respect the strategy even though it's destroying me.",
    "How do you consistently post the most frustratingly perfect teases? Is there a formula?",
    "I've thought about that photo more than I've thought about my own life problems. That's on you.",
    "The subtle skin flash in that photo... devastating. Absolutely devastating. Worth a DM.",
    "You treat revealing content like a drug dealer treats supply. Small doses. Keep us addicted. Smart.",
    "I didn't think 'almost showing something' could be this powerful. You've changed my understanding.",
    "That tease post just created a lifelong follower. Because now I HAVE to stick around for what comes next.",
    "My imagination was already vivid. After your photo, it's in IMAX. 🫠",
    "I dreamt about that photo last night. Not even kidding. You've infiltrated my subconscious.",
    "You've somehow made 'not showing' hotter than 'showing.' That's a superpower.",
    "If patience is a virtue then I've lost all virtue because of your posts. Show more. PLEASE."
