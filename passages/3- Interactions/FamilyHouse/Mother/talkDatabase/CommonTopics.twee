Oh sweetie, come here. Look at this recipe—does it say salt or sugar? I can't read it without my glasses.

Salt, mom. Half a teaspoon.

Ah, okay okay. I wanted to make something nice for dinner, your father keeps saying he's tired of the same meals.

Sweetie, can you grab the olive oil from the cabinet? This one's almost empty.

(Handing her the oil)
What are you making?

Just pasta. Nothing fancy. Everyone's been busy lately, no time for elaborate meals.

Mom, I know how to cook some things...

You know, when I was your age, I couldn't cook at all. My mother never taught me.

But you taught me.
