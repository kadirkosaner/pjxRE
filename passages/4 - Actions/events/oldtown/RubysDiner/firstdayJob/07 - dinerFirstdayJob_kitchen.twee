<<narrative "Entering the Kitchen">>
You step into the kitchen. A narrow, hot space. Burners blazing, pans sizzling. Steam everywhere.
Two people inside.
One – an older man with a beard – at the stove. Cracking eggs, making an omelet. Calm, slow movements. He looks experienced.
The other – a young man with scars – at the sink. Washing dishes. Sleeves rolled up, apron wet.

They both look up.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "dinerClerk">>
Our new teammate. Starting today. Dishwashing.
<</dialog>>
<<narrative>>
The bearded man – <<= setup.characterDefs.dinerChef.firstName>> – puts down the spatula. He looks at you. His eyes are sharp but not hostile. Just sizing you up.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "dinerChef">>
What's your name?

<<dialog "dinerChef">>
I'm <<= setup.characterDefs.dinerChef.firstName>>. I run the kitchen here.
<</dialog>>
<<narrative>>
He nods. Short, distant.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "dinerChef">>
Speed matters here. If dishes pile up, we stop. Got it?
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "player">>
Got it.
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "dinerChef">>
Good.
<</dialog>>
<<narrative>>
He turns back to flip the omelet. Conversation over as far as he's concerned.
The scarred man – <<= setup.characterDefs.dinerDishwasher.firstName>> – wipes his hands on a towel. He walks over. Smiles.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "dinerDishwasher">>
Hey, I'm <<= setup.characterDefs.dinerDishwasher.firstName>>. I'll be working with you.
<</dialog>>
<<narrative>>
He holds out his hand. You shake. His hand is wet but warm.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "dinerDishwasher">>
First day?
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "player">>
Yeah.
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "dinerDishwasher">>
I get it. I was nervous my first day too. But you'll get used to it. Easy job, really. Just gotta be fast.
<</dialog>>
<<narrative>>
He talks with a slight accent – maybe Spanish. Friendly, relaxed.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "dinerDishwasher">>
I'll show you everything in a bit. Don't worry.
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "dinerClerk">>
Alright. Let's keep going.
