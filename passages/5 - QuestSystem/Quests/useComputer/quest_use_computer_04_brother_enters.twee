<<narrative "Brother's Room">>
Your brother walks in, looking at his phone. He looks up when he sees you at the desk.

<<dialog "brother">>
Oh, you done?
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "player">>
Yeah, just looked up some stuff about the city.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "brother">>
(Leans against the desk)
Find anything good?
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "player">>
There's a career center at Town Hall. I'll probably check it out tomorrow.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "brother">>
Town Hall? I think I've seen it. My school should be around there.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "player">>
(Shrugs)
I don't know, it's only been a few days since we got here. Haven't explored much yet.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "brother">>
Actually, I think it's close. You'll find it easily. Makes sense to go there. But... I think there was a help wanted sign at the Corner Shop. Saw it yesterday when I walked by.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "player">>
Corner Shop? The one around our corner?
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "brother">>
Yeah. I think they're looking for someone.
<</dialog>>

<<narrative>>
You think about it. The Corner Shop is closer, simpler. Maybe it's a good place to start.
<</narrative>>

<<dialog "player">>
Okay, I'll check there first then. If that doesn't work out, I'll head to Town Hall.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "brother">>
(Smiles)
Anyway, if you're done, I'll take over the computer. You know, last days of summer break. Trying to enjoy them.
<</dialog>>

<<narrative>>
You stand up from the desk.
<</narrative>>

<<dialog "player">>
(Laughing)
You've trashed your room. Clean this place up sometime. Your desktop looks just as messy as your room.
<</dialog>>

<<narrative>>
Your brother quickly sits down in the chair you just left and clicks on a game.
<</narrative>>

<<dialog "brother">>
By the way, you can use my messy computer anytime, sis. Just not when I'm gaming.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "player">>
(Laughing)
Okay, thanks kiddo.
<</dialog>>

<<dialog "brother">>
Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
<</dialog>>

<<narrative>>
You slowly walk out of the room. The plan is clear in your head: Check the Corner Shop first, then Town Hall if needed.

Time to find a job.
