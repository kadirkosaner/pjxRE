You find your mother in the kitchen, unpacking boxes and trying to organize things.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "player">>
I'm back mom, got the groceries.
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "mother">>
(Looks up and smiles)
Oh you're back, thanks sweetie. How was it, did you find everything okay?
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "player">>
Yeah, no problem. The store is really close actually.
(Sets the bag on the counter)
Look, I even found a city map at the store. There's a park nearby too.
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "mother">>
(Looks at the map, smiles)
Oh nice, got yourself a new toy huh.
(Starts putting groceries away)
Ahh a park nearby is great, perfect for walks when you're bored.
(Pauses for a moment)
Though our neighborhood is really nice for that too, look at all the trees, wide streets...
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "player">>
(Smiles)
Yeah, I noticed on the way back. It's a quiet place.
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "mother">>
(Sighs, happy but tired)
We'll get used to it here... I just wish the moving truck would arrive so we can finally settle in.
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "player">>
What did dad say, the truck was coming today right?
<</dialog>>
<<dialog "mother">>
(Pauses)
Yeah, he called me earlier. He said they're on their way with $characters.brother.firstName.
<</dialog>>
<<narrative>>
Just then, you hear the front door open.
<</narrative>>
<<dialog "mother">>
(Looks toward the door)
Ah there they are.
(Calls out)
Welcome home sweethearts!
